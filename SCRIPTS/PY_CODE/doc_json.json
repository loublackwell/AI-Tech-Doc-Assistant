    "text": "Abstract - In recent years, with the enormous explosion of web based learning resources, personalization has become a critical factor for the success of services that wish to leverage the power of Web 2.0. However, the relevance, significance and impact of tailored content delivery in the learning domain is still questionable. Apart from considering only interaction based features like ratings and inferring learner preferences from them, if these services were to incorporate innate user profile attributes which affect learning activities, the quality of recommendations produced could be vastly improved. Recognizing the crucial role of effective guidance in informal educational settings, we provide a principled way of utilizing multiple sources of information from the user profile itself for the recommendation task. We explore factors that affect the choice of learning resources and explain in what way are they helpful to improve the pedagogical accuracy of learning objects systematical application of machine learning techniques, we further provide a technological solution to convert these indirectly mapped learner specific attributes into a direct mapping with the learning resources. This mapping has a distinct advantage of tagging learning resources to make their metadata more informative. The results of our empirical study depict the similarity of nominal learning attributes with respect to each other. We further succeed in capturing the learner subset, whose preferences are most likely to be an indication of learning resource usage. Our novel system filters learner profile attributes to discover a tag that links them with learning resources.",

    "text": "Apart from providing custom self paced learning tools, such organizations also measure student progress and provide targeted interventions. In contrast to formal education systems in schools and universities where predefined course structures, well formed accreditation procedures and a regular quality check of knowledge inflow and outflow is maintained by domain experts, informal learning is basically a kind of lifelong learning activity. Here, students are responsible for their own learning pace and path [1]. The process of learning is often self directed and heavily dependent on users preferences. Because of no directed course plan and massive enrollment to form such informal learning networks, these learners are often overwhelmed with a plethora of alternative learning resources to choose from. It is highly impossible for a faculty to cater to the individual problems of learners. As pointed out in [25], the problem of improving the quality of education is quite multifaceted and intricate. However, the suggestion of correct pathways to be followed while studying important concepts, can benefit these learners greatly. Though the field of TEL Recommender system(TEL RecSys) [2] addresses this scenario of mass customization, the major factor for deciding the most appropriate learning activities is still learner's rating, review of resources and his fundamental demographic information. This may work well for e-commerce recommender systems, but similar applications in the domain of learning may not be suitable.",

K-means is a widely adopted clustering method that starts out by creating 'k' different clusters and assigning each data point to one of the clusters based on some standard distance measure like Euclidean, Pearson correlation etc. At every iteration, centroid of the clusters are updated with the mean value of the data points assigned to that cluster. The idea is to minimize intra cluster distance and maximize inter cluster distance. Proposed in [22], K means clustering has been a widely studied unsupervised machine learning algorithm. 6)Apriori principle- Originally presented in [23], it optimizes association analysis in large scale machine learning. Either for finding out frequent itemsets or discovering association rules in large datasets, apriori principle is applied to reduce the number of possible interesting itemsets. Measures like support and confidence the levels are established associations discovered. Apriori principle says that if an itemset is infrequent, all it's supersets will also be infrequent. At every iteration of the algorithm, candidate itemsets are pruned if their support levels are below the minimum support. The process of joining lower order itemsets based on this criteria is repeated, until no more itemsets can be created further. 7)Non negative matrix factorization(NMF)- Formally defined in [24] for learning parts of objects and combining them to get an aggregate representation, NMF derives it's roots from linear algebra. The basic idea of NMF is that it decomposes matrix A into two matrices B(features) and C(weights) and also enforces a non negative constraint on the entries of these matrices. In machine learning, it is used as a feature extraction algorithm, where the decomposed matrices represent the extracted features in the observations and their importance or relevance to the observed data.",

Other critical factors related to student's academic profile and interests are left out. This leads to inaccurate and unsatisfactory recommendations most of the times. However, because learning takes place in extremely diverse and rich environments, we include the other dimensions as stated in Section II.I to make the learning model more helpful and close to real life behaviour. Because these user specific attributes do not have a direct link with the learning resources and due to the unavailability of tagged data for these resources, there is a need to incorporate such parameters into the recommendation framework. And our proposed solution finds a way to fill this missing link by using machine learning algorithms to accomplish the task at hand.",

In [17], Sicilia et al. carried out an empirical study on the Merlot repository dataset and concluded that ratings cannot correctly differentiate learner preferences. Results showed relatively high mean absolute errors of around 1.0 in a scale of 1 to 5. Psychological studies have stressed on the need to include personalization factors like collective intelligence, competencies of peer learners and learner's reaction towards the learning objects recommended, for inclusion in the design of TEL RecSys [18]. Instead of focusing on development of better algorithms, such learner centric factors can improve accuracy, as learners are both producers of data and recipients of information. A theoretical study on learner models like stereotype, overlay, differential, perturbation and plan models was made in [21], and a generic approach to build these models was provided. However, no algorithms or implementation details were described.",

In [12], these determinants were implemented in NetLogo simulation environment, with an objective of identifying the preference and competence gap of learners.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the identified user profile attributes have not been used for improving pedagogical accuracy of learning pathways.

We also plan to evaluate our system on \"SNAP Amazon product co purchasing network\" metadata [13], because it is more informative than the current dataset used in experimentation. Furthermore, as the system becomes bigger, accuracy could be tested by dynamically increasing support levels and getting top 'k' patterns of the highest order. The tags achieved at higher support levels would be better than the ones at lower support levels. The goal is to choose an optimal support level, so that order of attribute itemsets is as high as possible, and the number of those itemsets having same frequency is as small as possible. This will reduce ambiguity and control the trade off between which and how many attribute itemsets to use as a tag for the learning resource. Another possible research direction is to extend this simulation based model to develop real world datasets for TEL RecSys. Such an augmented labelling of learning resources will be more reflective of learner proficiencies and objectives.",
