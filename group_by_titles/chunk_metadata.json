        "Abstract - In recent years, with the enormous explosion of web based learning resources, personalization has become a critical factor for the success of services that wish to leverage the power of Web 2.0. However, the relevance, significance and impact of tailored content delivery in the learning domain is still questionable. Apart from considering only interaction based features like ratings and inferring learner preferences from them, if these services were to incorporate innate user profile attributes which affect learning activities, the quality of recommendations produced could be vastly improved. Recognizing the crucial role of effective guidance in informal educational settings, we provide a principled way of utilizing multiple sources of information from the user profile itself for the recommendation task. We explore factors that affect the choice of learning resources and explain in what way are they helpful to improve the pedagogical accuracy of learning objects recommended. Through a systematical application of machine learning techniques, we further provide a technological solution to convert these indirectly mapped learner specific attributes into a direct mapping with the learning resources. This mapping has a distinct advantage of tagging learning resources to make their metadata more informative. The results of our empirical study depict the similarity of nominal learning attributes with respect to each other. We further succeed in capturing the learner subset, whose preferences are most likely to be an indication of learning resource usage. Our novel system filters learner profile attributes to discover a tag that links them with learning resources.",

        "Education has been acknowledged as one of the major pillars to support and improve lives of the economically disadvantaged [26]. Technology enhanced learning(TEL) aims to enhance learning practices of individuals and organizations by the design, development and testing of interactive socio technical innovations [2]. It provides an opportunity to unleash the full potential of machine learning algorithms and apply them to quantify and incorporate psychological factors that affect learning. As the web is becoming more ubiquitous, an increased number of learners are gradually turning towards online education to seek additional support and guidance. Therefore, improving learner experience is also another major focus of TEL. Over the years, various learning repositories",
        "like Khan Academy, Merlot(with more than 20,000 learning resources and about 70,000 registered users), OER Commons(with about 18,000 resources), European Schoolnet's Learning Resource Exchange(with more than 43,000 learning resources from 25 different content providers in Europe and beyond), online education platforms like Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Khan Academy, Venture Lab and e-learning platforms NPTEL have been established. They provide personalized learning environments and offer pedagogical support for learners in informal educational settings.",
        "Apart from providing custom self paced learning tools, such organizations also measure student progress and provide targeted interventions. In contrast to formal education systems in schools and universities where predefined course structures, well formed accreditation procedures and a regular quality check of knowledge inflow and outflow is maintained by domain experts, informal learning is basically a kind of lifelong learning activity. Here, students are responsible for their own learning pace and path [1]. The process of learning is often self directed and heavily dependent on users preferences. Because of no directed course plan and massive enrollment to form such informal learning networks, these learners are often overwhelmed with a plethora of alternative learning resources to choose from. It is highly impossible for a faculty to cater to the individual problems of learners. As pointed out in [25], the problem of improving the quality of education is quite multifaceted and intricate. However, the suggestion of correct pathways to be followed while studying important concepts, can benefit these learners greatly. Though the field of TEL Recommender system(TEL RecSys) [2] addresses this scenario of mass customization, the major factor for deciding the most appropriate learning activities is still learner's rating, review of resources and his fundamental demographic information. This may work well for e-commerce recommender systems, but similar applications in the domain of learning may not be suitable.",
        "Basically there are the two major differences between product recommendations and TEL RecSys that need to be considered. Firstly, learning is an activity that takes more time, considering the different study goals of individuals and their grasping capabilities. Also, the end objective may be variable.",
        "* Corresponding author: Tel.: +82513201724, Email: dkkang@dongseo.ac.kr",
        "Learners may wish to have different accomplishments after completion of a learning resource. Secondly, the most preferred(rated) learning path may not be pedagogically the most adequate [3]. Thus, the educational specific needs and information seeking tasks of stakeholders, make the design of learning resource recommendation quite complex [16].",
        "Our statement of contribution in this paper is to develop a system that can effectively categorize resources based on inherent factors that affect student's learning. We aim to extract such learning domain specific attributes of learners, that have been discovered from past theoretical research. Such critical factors belong to an entirely different context and play a much more significant role, as compared to basic profile information like name, age, sex and other demographic factors. We believe that our system has the potential of improving alignment of learner's preferences with the learning resources they are using. Also, it could increase learning efficiency, through a more structured guidance that is well customized and adapted to the learner's objectives.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: In section II.I, the technical terms used are defined. Then, in the following sections II.II and II.III, the user profile attributes are described and challenges are presented. The hypothesis, problem statement and the proposed method is described in detail in section III. Section IV talks about the experimental results and discussions. Prior work is discussed in section V. The conclusion and future work follow at the end in section VI and VII.",

        "1)Learning Management system(LMS)- It is a system that assists learners in finding learning resources and guides them to make the best choices in managing these resources. It also supports these learners in achieving their goals in a specific domain. A good literature review of LMS can be found in [4]. 2)Learning pathway- A set of learning objects like books, multimedia(audio recordings, videos), images, slides etc which are packaged and organized in a sequence form a learning pathway. A formal definition of the same can be found in [5]. 3)Transfer Learning- The process of applying concepts and skills learned in one domain to another related or disjoint domain in different scenarios is called transfer learning [6]. The absence of a guide to assist learners in providing a good cross domain application context, makes an understanding of the research issues associated with transfer learning quite difficult.",
        "4)Pedagogical adequacy(accuracy)- It is the kind of education that focuses equally on five different aspects of learning- student centred tutelage with an understanding of his educational background, strategic course instruction design to maximize learning, evaluation of student's advancement towards the course learning objectives for knowledge retention, use of different teaching strategies, awareness regarding teaching challenges and knowing ways to handle"

        "5)K-means clustering- Intuitively, what clustering techniques",
        "aim to achieve is finding data points which are more similar to one another than the rest of the points in n-dimensional feature space. K-means is a widely adopted clustering method that starts out by creating 'k' different clusters and assigning each data point to one of the clusters based on some standard distance measure like Euclidean, Pearson correlation etc. At every iteration, centroid of the clusters are updated with the mean value of the data points assigned to that cluster. The idea is to minimize intra cluster distance and maximize inter cluster distance. Proposed in [22], K means clustering has been a widely studied unsupervised machine learning algorithm. 6)Apriori principle- Originally presented in [23], it optimizes association analysis in large scale machine learning. Either for finding out frequent itemsets or discovering association rules in large datasets, apriori principle is applied to reduce the number of possible interesting itemsets. Measures like support and confidence levels are established to evaluate associations discovered. Apriori principle says that if an itemset is infrequent, all it's supersets will also be infrequent. At every iteration of the algorithm, candidate itemsets are pruned if their support levels are below the minimum support. The process of joining lower order itemsets based on this criteria is repeated, until no more itemsets can be created further. the",
        "7)Non negative matrix factorization(NMF)- Formally defined in [24] for learning parts of objects and combining them to get an aggregate representation, NMF derives it's roots from linear algebra. The basic idea of NMF is that it decomposes matrix A into two matrices B(features) and C(weights) and also enforces a non negative constraint on the entries of these matrices. In machine learning, it is used as a feature extraction algorithm, where the decomposed matrices represent the extracted features in the observations and their importance or relevance to the observed data."

        "Though technology alone cannot solve complex problems like providing universal and high quality education, but it can surely improve the quality of solutions and their impact on learning. This is the driving factor behind our work.",
        "1)We notice that a major issue in TEL RecSys is the use of only learner ratings, reviews and basic profile information for providing tailored learning pathways. Other critical factors related to student's academic profile and interests are left out. This leads to inaccurate and unsatisfactory recommendations most of the times. However, because learning takes place in extremely diverse and rich environments, we include the other dimensions as stated in Section II.I to make the learning model more helpful and close to real life behaviour. Because these user specific attributes do not have a direct link with the learning resources and due to the unavailability of tagged data for these resources, there is a need to incorporate such parameters into the recommendation framework. And our proposed solution finds a way to fill this missing link by using machine learning algorithms to accomplish the task at hand.",
        "2)The other challenge while applying machine learning to make appropriate sense of the user profile attributes is that, though skill levels and learning time can be inferred numerically, learning strategy and presentation style are very nominal in nature. Deriving similarities between them is quite difficult numerically. We cannot represent such nominal variables on a continuous scale and perform arithmetic operations on them. For example, it's difficult to comprehend, how similar or dissimilar test taking and mnemonic learning strategies are, without any training data. This fact has useful implications, because distance measures like Euclidean,",
        "Pearson correlation etc. can't be applied to address such a situation. Thus, there is a need to characterize the data further to leverage these nominal attributes."

The only shortcoming is that we cannot explicitly infer user satisfaction and correctness of the proposed learning pathway through a questionnaire. However, the importance and relevance of implicit inference lies in the fact that it can be collected more easily and at lower cost to the user, although inferences about learning resource desirability will be slightly less accurate than explicitly supplied feedback [15].",

Using intelligent multi attribute visualization techniques, we plotted the clustering results for learning resource with ISBN \"000649840X\" and ISBN \"0684867621\" in the dataset, and came up with interesting observations. In Fig (vii), each attribute is represented in a vertical line, where the maximum and minimum values of that dimension are scaled to the upper and lower points on these vertical lines. For 5 visualized attributes, 4 lines connected to each vertical line at the appropriate dimensional value represent a 5-dimensional point. The plot shows few prominent horizontal lines(data points), which intuitively represent strong candidates for tagging learning resources. Coming to Fig (viii), it provides further enhancements to the visualization by depicting data points that are attracted to anchors with value dependent positions. The data instances are placed inside a 5-sided polygon because the clustering process is based on 5 different learner profile attributes.",

        "Next, on applying association analysis to the data points of the largest cluster, we get the certain tags based on most frequently occurring attribute itemsets. Keeping the support level constant at 0.1, we generate tags for each of the learning resources, four of which are shown in Fig (ix). If there are many tags having same frequencies, we generate tag clouds for the corresponding learning resources, where each cloud can hold more than one kind of preference(tag).",
        "Though some of the current tags do not include all 5 user profile attributes, we claim that the system will generate better and higher order tags, once more number of learners start using the system. This is because the input learner subset will grow in size at each step of the system and this will increase the number of possible combinations of learner profile attributes. The justification seems valid, because our proposed system is a bottom up system which incrementally improves as learners and their ratings increase. It is feasible for lifelong learning scenarios with changing learning actions.",

      "supporting_text": [
        "In this section, we describe the prior studies that have been made in the context of development of learner models for educational adaptive hypermedia. In [17], Sicilia et al. carried out an empirical study on the Merlot repository dataset and concluded that ratings cannot correctly differentiate learner preferences. Results showed relatively high mean absolute errors of around 1.0 in a scale of 1 to 5. Psychological studies have stressed on the need to include personalization factors like collective intelligence, competencies of peer learners and learner's reaction towards the learning objects recommended, for inclusion in the design of TEL RecSys [18]. Instead of focusing on development of better algorithms, such learner centric factors can improve accuracy, as learners are both producers of data and recipients of information. A theoretical study on learner models like stereotype, overlay, differential, perturbation and plan models was made in [21], and a generic approach to build these models was provided. However, no algorithms or implementation details were described.",
        "In [19], Verbert et al. did a survey on context aware",
        "recommender systems and classified the context framework of TEL RecSys on the basis of computing, location, time, activity, physical conditions, resource and users. The study showed that less than half of the TEL RecSys actually took computing context into consideration. For a majority of them, the implementation was still in the prototype phase. Learner characteristics like basic personal information, prior knowledge level(performance), interests, learning goals, cognitive style and affects(emotions) were identified as key points for consideration in providing personalized learning services. In [12], these determinants were implemented in NetLogo simulation environment, with an objective of identifying the preference and competence gap of learners. Formulas for implicit and explicit learning variables laid the basis of determining the percentage of graduates, their satisfaction levels and time taken to graduate. However, to the best of our knowledge, the identified user profile attributes have not been used for improving pedagogical accuracy of learning pathways. And because this a relatively new area, not much work has been done in applying machine learning oriented approaches to leverage such user tagged parameters. So, it is not trivial to use the previous work along this line to directly serve as subcomponents in our setting.",
        "VI. CONCLUSION",
        "In this paper, we have designed a solution to cater to learning resource recommendations that inaccurate and less relevant. This disturbs learners and wastes their precious time in searching for the apt learning resources. We call this area of technology enhanced learning sensitive because today, many people from different demographics having different competencies, different ways of learning and interpretation, collaborate on online education portals and leverage resources",
        "from learning repositories to improve their skill set. Because of the inefficiency of human support that can be provided to such a large learning network, intelligent ways are required to match learner's actual preferences with learning resources. And leveraging user specific learning attributes is one of the ways to model real life learner behaviour and improve the pedagogical accuracy of suggested learning pathways."

        "For future work, we aim to address hypothesis H2, as explained in Section III.I. We also plan to evaluate our system on \"SNAP Amazon product co purchasing network\" metadata [13], because it is more informative than the current dataset used in experimentation. Furthermore, as the system becomes bigger, accuracy could be tested by dynamically increasing support levels and getting top 'k' patterns of the highest order. The tags achieved at higher support levels would be better than the ones at lower support levels. The goal is to choose an optimal support level, so that order of attribute itemsets is as high as possible, and the number of those itemsets having same frequency is as small as possible. This will reduce ambiguity and control the trade off between which and how many attribute itemsets to use as a tag for the learning resource. Another possible research direction is to extend this simulation based model to develop real world datasets for TEL RecSys. Such an augmented labelling of learning resources will be more reflective of learner proficiencies and objectives.",

He was working alone one night and his hand got caught in the fan belt while the engine was running. He was conscious long enough to get the engine to stop running with his other hand, but his right was stuck and he couldn’t get out on his own. He eventually lost consciousness and lay there bleeding for three hours by himself. Bleeding this long could easily have resulted in death. Luckily he only lost his fingers.

The proper lifting points on a vehicle are the locations on the vehicle where you place the jack to lift the vehicle and where the jack stands are placed to keep the vehicle elevated. Lifting points are different on every vehicle. The owner’s manual will specify where the lifting points are for your specific vehicle. Often vehicles have lift points marked on the running board or rocker panel. There are a couple of disastrous events that can happen during an attempt to raise a vehicle without using the proper lifting points. The weight of the car pressing down and the jack pressing up can damage the body of the vehicle. Or worse, the jack could tip or slide while a person is underneath the vehicle.",

Any corrosion or signs of leaks around the battery are indications of a problem. Corrosion can be a green or white powdery substance. Don’t ever allow corrosion to come in contact with the skin or eyes because this is an acid and it will burn. If corrosion is present at all, the battery may need to be replaced or there could be a problem with the charging system. Excessive discharging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping the cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery.",
        "The presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as a temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You'll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion.

If multiple fuses happen to get pulled at the same time then the size and placement of each fuse can be found in the owner’s manual.",

There is a reason why they show videos of people in car accidents to Driver's Ed students. They want you to understand that when you get behind the wheel you’re potentially putting people in danger. Ideally, seat belts would be more like the harnesses used in roller coasters, which include two shoulder straps and a middle fastening device at the chest. The cross-over shoulder strap isn’t very effective in comparison. It is designed that way for commercial purposes and to account for common human behavior. It’s easier and quicker to have one buckle where the belt can be pulled over and fastened in one quick motion while the person is just getting into the car. While the conventional seat belt isn’t 100% efficient, it is potentially the most important safety feature of the vehicle because it keeps the body harnessed and kept in the seat.

Most devices with steering capability do not have a caster angle of zero. When the deviation is towards the rear, the caster is considered positive. When the deviation is towards the front, the caster is considered negative. On motor vehicles the caster is usually positive, (the higher ball joint will be closer to the rear than the lower ball joint). This helps the vehicle to drive straight even when the steering wheel is hands-free. Since the view of the caster is blocked by the wheel on vehicles with four wheels, it is most easily visible on motorcycles and bicycles. Think of the two braces that come down on both sides of the front wheel. Notice how the handlebars are closer to the rear than the center point (fulcrum) of the front wheel. This is a clearly visible positive caster. The front wheels of shopping carts have a negative caster. The physics of a negative caster allows for the front wheels to turn counter clockwise as the cart is turning clockwise so that the cart is easier to maneuver throughout the store.",

        "In a modern vehicle the ignition system consists of a crankshaft position sensor, which sends a signal to the PCM (powertrain control module or computer). The PCM interprets the signal and sends a signal to the ignition coils on each cylinder. Then the ignition coils fire through the spark plugs. Some vehicles will use one coil for two cylinders, and some have a separate coil for each cylinder. When one coil is used for two cylinders, the spark plugs for both cylinders fire at the same time, but one of the cylinders will be in the exhaust step of the Otto cycle, so it’s kind of a waste spark (not used to ignite fuel).",
        "The ignition system works in conjunction with fuel injection (Chapter 7) so that the correct Otto Cycle of events occurs in the cylinders. The cylinders of internal combustion engines are numbered and the firing sequence occurs in a specific order. The firing order can vary by vehicle make and model. The engine size is also a factor.",
        "For example, in an 8 cylinder Chevy engine the cylinders might be numbered 1, 3, 5, 7 on the driver's side (or left side of the engine from the driver’s perspective), and 2, 4, 6, 8 on the passenger side. The firing order for this particular engine would be 1, 8, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 2.",

The lower gears are used for lower speeds, while the higher gears are used for higher speeds. Yet, the RPM which is read on the dashboard tachometer may be relatively constant (or stay within a range) through all speeds. The transmission, which is where the actual gears are located, takes an input speed from the crankshaft and reduces it to the output speed until the vehicle is in “direct” drive. In other words, it changes the gear ratios. So, in first gear you might have an input to output ratio of 4 to 1. This means that as the input shaft goes around four times, the output shaft goes around one time. At 4,000 RPMs input you would have 1,000 RPMs output. Second gear may have a 3 to 1 ratio and third gear a 2 to 1 ratio. Fourth gear would be direct drive with a 1 to 1 ratio.",

There are spider gears inside the center section of the differential that allow the wheels to travel different distances while turning. Consider a car that is turning right. The driver’s side rear wheel travels a farther distance than the passenger side rear wheel. Think of using a protractor to draw a circle.

There is no blanket measurement for brake pad thickness since the thickness of new pads can vary by make and model of the vehicle. A few millimeters could appear brand new in one car but be an indication for pad replacement in another. If the thickness of the pad is 20% of the original thickness or less, then the pads should be replaced. The original thickness can be found in the service manual for the vehicle.",

        "Consumers should be aware of how the auto repair industry works. When you bring your vehicle to an auto repair shop and enter the office, you’re usually greeted by a service writer. It doesn’t matter if you go to a dealership, a franchised shop (like Midas or Firestone), or a small independent shop -- more often than not, the service writer is the first person you meet. The service writer acts as an intermediary between you and the repair technician. He tells the technician to inspect the car, the technician informs him what the findings are, and then he comes back to you with the findings. Some shops allow the customer to come into the repair room to see the technician’s findings, but many don’t.",
        "The service writer is evaluated by upper management, which may include the manager of the shop, a director of one or many shops, and/or the owner. The owners of large shops are not usually onsite and function mostly as investors. They’re hoping to make a return on their investment. Directors may manage multiple shops or be the head of an entire department, such as the service department at a dealership.",

        "Illustration of how the auto repair industry is organized",
        "Since the service writer is a middleman between the customer and the technician, there are frequent communication problems that can occur. A customer may come into the shop and say that the car makes a squeaking sound when the brakes are applied. The service writer thinks it’s the brake pads, so he tells the technician to inspect the brake pads. There may be nothing wrong with the brake pads. What the service writer should have done is write down that there is a squeaking sound when the brakes are applied. Then the technician can diagnose the problem better. Similar communication issues can also occur in the other direction. The technician may explain problems or findings to the service writer and the service writer may fail to relay the information correctly to the customer.",

        "www.CrawfordsAutoService.com",
        "The service writer is first and foremost a salesman, not a technician. His knowledge and understanding of how a vehicle works is often not any greater than the customer's. Some service writers can be very knowledgeable about cars; others are not. In either case, when the customer speaks to him, he will appear to understand what is wrong with the vehicle.",
        "A major problem with the entire industry, from the technicians to upper management, is that everyone is paid on commission. This means that they are motivated and rewarded to increase sales and raise the price in order to make more money. The services that they suggest are often not damaging to the car; they’re just not necessary. They may say that your cooling system needs a flush when it doesn’t or they could fudge the numbers on maintenance intervals to increase the frequency of services. Maintenance services are often based on mileage, so it’s easy for a shop to say that a service is required at 30,000 miles when it actually isn’t due until 90,000 miles. By changing the interval to every 30,000 miles, they sell the service three times instead of one. This is why it is important to review the maintenance chart in the owner’s manual of the vehicle. Also, some repairs are needed at an earlier time than what is specified in the owner’s manual. This will be based on certain conditions which can include the weather, the driving route, the driver’s habits, and other environmental conditions where the vehicle is driven or parked on a regular basis.",
        "Auto dealerships generally have a service department and a sales department which are run as two separate businesses. The sales department is actually a customer to the service department. The sales department is responsible for moving inventory (selling cars on the lot). The service department is responsible for providing services which include inspections, maintenance and repairs. The sales department is a customer to the service department because every vehicle has be inspected and serviced before it can be sold. Since the service writer is still paid by commission even when ordering services for the same dealership, he can often tell the sales department that a particular vehicle can’t be placed out on the lot unless it receives all the top services. Since the sales department wants to sell the vehicle, they have no other choice than to accept the services and pass the additional costs on to the customer. The service department is the one that determines whether a vehicle can be put on the lot, not the sales department. This arrangement can be a safeguard for the vehicles being sold and add protection to buyers. However, it also gives the services writers more control and it is often used to increase commissions.",
        "When people take their cars to the dealership for maintenance, they are often under the impression that the dealership has a certified technician performing the repairs. Often the technicians are just kids out of high school with little training or experience. These entry level employees are often called “lube techs” because traditionally the job only involves changing the oil. However, today some dealerships allow lube techs to perform any repair that they feel comfortable doing, even if they weren't specifically trained for it. This saves the dealership money because the lube techs aren’t paid as much as the certified technicians.",

        "By contributing author Rex Kimball",
        "Buying a big-ticket item, like a vehicle, can be daunting, especially if the buyer doesn’t know where to start. This chapter offers a beginner’s guide to buying a vehicle. Yet, when it comes to buying a vehicle, serious buyers will go beyond the steps described here. For example, this chapter may mention the art of negotiation, yet entire books have been written on the subject of negotiating, and increasing one’s skill in negotiation will help the buyer to get a better deal.",
        "One of the most important things for potential car buyers to know is that the majority of vehicles depreciate in value over time. If you purchase a new or used vehicle from a dealership, the vehicle depreciates by about 20% of the sale price the minute it is driven off the lot. That means that if you turned around and sold the vehicle within a week, you’d probably only be able to sell it for about 20% less than you paid for it. It’s not like buying a house where the property generally increases in value over time (except during economic decline). Vehicles are not investments; they’re simply a necessary expense in locations that don’t have good public transportation as an alternative. (They could be investments if you get involved in the collector's market, which is an entirely different game).",
        "It is also important to realize that the cost in owning a vehicle is much more than simply the sales price of the vehicle. All expenses must be considered before accepting the burden on your monthly budget. The sales price of the vehicle is just the beginning. If you're taking out a loan to pay for the vehicle then you'll first have the monthly loan payment.",
        "You'll also have to pay for gas to run the vehicle. The price of gas varies from week to week and by location. Wednesday is probably the best day of the week to buy gas. You also don’t want to fill up while the service truck is at the gas station refilling the storage tanks. When they refill the tanks there are contaminants at the bottom that get stirred up and these contaminants can come through the gas pumps and into your vehicle. Granted, you learned about the fuel filter in Chapter 7, but there is no sense in wearing it out sooner than you have to. Go to www.MapQuest.com and click on “gas prices” to find the best gas prices in your area. The amount of gas that you have to purchase from week to week will depend on how much you drive and the gas mileage of the vehicle that you purchase.",
        "Gas mileage is calculated by the change in mileage divided by gallons used (or miles per gallon, MPG). The next time you go to the gas station to refuel, fill the gas tank to full and write down the mileage that appears on your odometer. Then, after you’ve driven for a while, return to the gas station and fill the gas tank to full. The amount of gallons that you purchased is the amount of gas that you used from full tank to full tank after driving for that time. That number goes in the denominator of the equation. The number of gallons will appear on the pump display and on your receipt. When refilling the second time, you'll also record the mileage on your odometer. The change in",

        "When shopping for vehicles, you can look up the gas mileage as one of the features. (Go to any page past the home page at www.CrawfordsAutoService.com to use the free tool on the sidebar). The reported gas mileage is a statistical average that the vehicle generally gets and the vehicle that you purchase could get better or worse gas mileage depending on the condition of the vehicle and the roads where you will be driving.",
        "There will be a monthly fee for vehicle insurance. Insurance fees will vary by the amount of coverage that you want. Liability insurance only pays for any damages that you might cause to the other party when you get in an accident and you are at fault. It won’t pay to replace your vehicle or for your potential medical bills. You'll also want to consider whether you want roadside service in case the vehicle breaks down, or coverage for car rental fees in case you need a replacement vehicle while your vehicle is repaired. This additional coverage cost more per month.",
        "There are many car insurance companies. Some of the more frequently advertised companies are Geico, All State, Progressive, Farmers, Esurance, and Liberty Mutual. Yet, there are many, many others. Their advertisements often tout that by simply giving them a call you could save a significant amount on your monthly insurance bill. That is true because each of their coverage plans are catered to specific types of drivers and these plans change from year to year. Hypothetically, this year Insurance Company A might have better rates for the common commuter with nothing on their driving record, while Insurance Company B might have the best rates for single mothers who are transporting three or more children on a regular basis. When they determine the monthly rate, they take many factors into consideration and many of these factors are company secrets that aren’t publicly announced to potential customers. So, the best way to find the best deal is to get a quote from each company.",
        "Some ways to reduce your monthly insurance cost are to never get a speeding ticket, never get in an accident, get good grades if you’re a student, get married, be within a certain income bracket (not too low or too high), be female, and stay in frequent contact with the insurance company. Most of these factors are based on statistics. They’re not being sexist or having other forms of bias; they have the research and numbers to justify charging a higher monthly fee for drivers who are at a higher risk. Also, many insurance companies offer discounts if you combine your car insurance with other types of insurance that they offer, such as home owner’s insurance. They call it bundle discounts.",
        "Shopping for the best car insurance can be a long process. Without a doubt there is a large percentage of car insurance customers who are paying more because they’re too",

        "Crawford’s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair",
        "www.CrawfordsAutoService.com",
        "intimidated by the research that is required for finding the best deal. You should get used to the idea that you'll frequently need to call the insurance company and be put on hold to wait for a representative. Be adamant enough with the representatives to get the best deals and avoid getting ripped off, yet be courteous and professional enough so that the representative will still want to help you. Shopping for car insurance can start simultaneously with shopping for the vehicle. Some companies may be able to help you identify the vehicles with the lowest monthly insurance rates. Yet, some of them might not be able to provide a quote until you can tell them which vehicle you'll be driving.",
        "Besides the vehicle price, gas and insurance, there will be yearly fees for vehicle registration. You can find out the yearly registration fee by contacting your local Motor Vehicle Division (MVD or DMV) or your state’s department of transportation. Some states require vehicle inspections and emissions testing before your vehicle can be registered. This information is also available at the DMV.",
        "There will also be costs for maintenance and repair. The best way to reduce these costs is by taking care of the vehicle and following the maintenance chart in the owner’s manual. If the vehicle has a service light illuminated on the dashboard or if the vehicle starts to have symptoms - don’t neglect it. Neglect will lead to further damage, which will require more expensive repairs. A simple example is brake pad replacement. Replacing the brake pads could cost about $200; but if you wait until the pads wear down completely and you start grinding metal on the rotor, then the repair could easily be $800 or more (review Chapter 10 for brakes). If the vehicle is well-maintained, it will last a lot longer -- maybe even 15 years longer or more. Overall, it costs less to maintain a vehicle than to buy new vehicles more frequently.",
        "Maintenance costs will be a factor for determining which vehicle to purchase since some makes and models cost more to maintain than others. Often, a more expensive sales price of the vehicle also means that replacement parts and maintenance will cost more. Some car manufacturers could even have the same part for the basic and sporty models. Yet, if the same part is ordered for the sporty model then it will cost more. The parts manufacturer figures that if the customer could pay for the sportier model then they can also pay more for the part, even if it’s the exact same part with a different label.",

For example, in Arizona they might add a “desert care package” and it will be listed with all the other fees. Since most customers don’t know what the desert care package is, they don’t ask about it. It essentially means that they tinted the windows without asking if you wanted it, and they will absolutely be charging you more than it would cost to tint the windows privately. They might also list “theft protection” as one of the fees. This means that they had a technician etch a number into the windows. They might charge $200 for this service which takes the technician about 10-15 minutes to perform. Also, if you’re vehicle gets stolen, the police department won’t use this number to identify your vehicle. They'll use the VIN (vehicle identification number).",
        "The dealership will have many tricks for justifying an increased price on the bottom line. You can avoid some of these expenses by going through each item on the list and asking them to describe exactly what this means. Don’t accept the sales description; tell them to really explain it. Then, if you don’t want it on the bill, tell them to take it off. If you buy from a dealership you can expect to spend the entire day there. Dealerships also offer poor trade-in value for your prior vehicle.",
        "If you decide to buy from a dealership, the best time of the year to buy is December, particularly on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. In any given month, the inventory on the lot isn’t necessarily owned by the dealership. They have the vehicles on a “floor money” loan. If they don’t keep the vehicle beyond a certain time period, they don’t have to pay interest on the loan, and they make the profit from the sale without an additional expense. If you happen to pick a vehicle that is near the end of its loan period, then the dealership might be willing to sell it at a cheaper price. December is a particularly good time since people are more willing to buy during the holidays and the dealerships want to increase their sales numbers before the end of the year. This makes them more willing to negotiate, regardless of whether the loan period for the vehicle is ending.",
        "If you buy from a private owner, there is no guarantee that they won’t tell you little white lies about the vehicle in order to get you to buy it. However, a private owner won't be as likely to trick you into spending more for the vehicle than it’s worth. There are tools that you can use to determine the value of the vehicle, and give you a more accurate starting point for a fair price.",
        "Before deciding which vehicle to purchase, you'll want to write down some of the features you want, or decide on the purposes that the vehicle will serve. A pickup truck might make an excellent working vehicle, but the gas mileage could make it a lousy commuter vehicle. Will it be meant for one driver or more than one driver? How many passengers will be transported on a regular basis? Do you need a lot of trunk space? Do you plan on driving it until it dies, or will you sell it once it reaches a certain age or mileage? If you know that you'll eventually sell it, then you'll want to pick a make and model with a good reputation for resale value.

You'll want to make sure it comes with a complete spare tire kit. Try looking down the side of the vehicle at different angles to see how the light reflects off the paint. If you detect two different coats of paint or areas where touch up paint has been applied then ask the seller about it. If the side panels and doors look smooth from one angle but then you detect some waviness when looking from a different angle, then the vehicle may have been in a side-impact collision and its safety features could be compromised.",

Find a place where you can develop a direct working relationship with the technician and not a service writer (review Chapter 11 for a description of service writers). Crawford’s Auto Repair would be your best choice for a pre-purchase inspection if you live in the Mesa-Chandler-Gilbert area of Arizona. Some shops offer a free estimate but if they know you’re requesting the evaluation to buy a vehicle, then they might charge for the inspection since there is less of a chance of you buying their repair services. The inspection fee will be worth it because the trained eye of the mechanic and the tools they use for diagnostics will enable them to spot things that you don’t even know to look for. They'll look at the body of the vehicle from the inside, raise it up and look at the drive train and the underside of the engine, the brakes, and they'll attach their diagnostic device to the vehicle computer to receive any trouble codes that are stored on the vehicle’s computer. A mechanic’s inspection will tell you much more information than simply looking at the vehicle or test driving it yourself.

Between Blue Book and the mechanic, keep this baseline estimate in mind and do not go over it when negotiating. First of all, are you willing to pay this baseline estimate for the vehicle? If you don’t want the vehicle enough to negotiate, then just let the owner know that after evaluating the vehicle you’re not interested. If you are interested then you can start negotiating.",

If the asking price is above your baseline estimate then still do not go above your baseline. You'll want to make a counter offer to be as low as it can be without being offensive. It should at least be a couple hundred dollars lower than the Kelly Blue Book estimate. And you'll use the information you gathered during the inspection to justify the lower offer. If it needs a repair, then you'll mention that the price of the repair should be deducted from the asking price.",
        "Be patient. Do not get excited to buy a vehicle. Read the seller's body language. Hold your ground. Read a book on negotiation, or many books. There is so much to this art and usually the better negotiator gets the deal he or she wants while the other person makes compromises. If you’re too anxious to buy the vehicle or if you’re too lazy to go through the process of calling sellers and inspecting a vehicle more than once, then you'll probably pay more. Expect to go through this process a few times before finding a satisfying deal.",
        "After you agree on a price, the seller will take the title to the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or a private title shop and get the title notarized for selling the vehicle. You might use that time to go to the bank or a title loan store to get the money to pay for the vehicle. You can arrange for the best type of payment with the seller. If you pay for it in full from your bank account, then paying with a cashier’s check made out to the seller may be more secure than carrying cash. Then you and the seller will meet up again to trade the payment for the title and keys. After you receive the title, you'll have to take it to the DMV or to an independent title service shop to have a new title drawn up in your name and get your license plate. Within the next 10 days you'll also need to call the insurance company to have the new vehicle added to your current coverage plan or purchase new insurance.",
        "Finding the right vehicle for your needs at the right price will be very rewarding. If you do your homework, put in the effort and follow the steps in this chapter, then you'll be able to find a good vehicle that you can afford. Good luck!",
